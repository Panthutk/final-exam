# final-exam
- From the starting code, polygon_art.py, you are to write an OO program that generates different pieces of art works
- Fork, then, clone this repo
- Read the instructions given in the course's Google Classroom and start coding
- Once you are done, push your final code to your Github repo and modify this README to report on the work you have done


1. Create Polygon Class and set function __init__(self) to contain the following variable
*turtle speed = set speed
*turtle bgcolor = set background color
*turtle tracer = set tracer
*turtle color mode = turtle color mode set to 255
*num sides = random side
*size = random size
*orientation = random orientation
*location = random location
*color = random color by calling polygon.get_new_color
*border_size 
*Called Polygon.draw_polygon with contain all previous variables

2. Create get_new_color function and return 3 random color code each of them max 255

3. draw_polygon function used the variable from __inti__ to draw a polygon at current position

4. reposition function we set the reduction_ratio at main and send the following variable to reposition function in polygon class to make it penup and move to random location and continue draw the polygon

5. about main I create a main that can select that you can choose to random or manual side I didnt do for loop because time is almost up but you can keep spam 1 for random image and get the if 4 in introduction by professor and choice 2 for manual you can get the same side with any amount by same type same side and repeat 2 and for choice 3 I used for exit program
